🖥️ Active Directory Homelab

This is a home lab I created to learn and demonstrate skills in Windows Server administration, Active Directory, and networking.

🔧 Lab Tools

    VirtualBox

    Windows Server 2022 (Domain Controller)

    Windows 10 Enterprise (Domain-Joined Client)

🏗️ What I Set Up

    Configured AD DS and created a domain: lucaslab.local

    Created Organizational Units (IT, HR, Sales)

    Added users and security groups

    Applied Group Policy Objects (GPOs) to control user access (e.g., hide Control Panel)

    Scoped GPOs by security group membership to target policies precisely and avoid unwanted application

    Set up DHCP to automatically assign IP and DNS

    Verified domain join and policy application on the client
